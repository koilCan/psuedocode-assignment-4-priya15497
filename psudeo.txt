choose all players- 2 or more;

start seperating the cards evenly by the number of players;

//To play UNO, each player has to match the card in the discard pile by number, color, or word.

If a player places a wild card:
  Then the player can change the color of play;
  
If a player pulls out a reverse card:
  the order of the play is changed; 
  
If a player pulls out a Wild Draw 4 card:
  the player gets to change the color like the wild card;
  the player next to him has to pick up four cards;

If you have one card left:
  you must shout out UNO!;
  
    If you don't call "Uno" and you get caught by another player:
      you must pick up two cards from the draw pile;
      
      if a player has no cards left:
        the game is over;
        
Points are scored;

start over again;

If you win the game:
  //you give yourself points according to the number and type of cards left in opponents' hands'
  
  add up points;
  
  Number cards: 
  Face value; 
  
  Non-wild word cards:
  20 points; 
  
  Wild cards:
  50 points;
  
The first player to reach 500 points wins the game;
